** Game feel

- [ ] Write better screen shake
- [ ] Longer slow motion that stops when dash is continued
- [ ] Allow set direction after dash if no button is pressed before
- [ ] Buffer inputs
- [ ] Different Player animation / sprites for damage
  - Maybe some blood effects
  - The Damage can also change how the player controls / what abilities he as
  - Should be balanced e.g. more speed less damage (or probably the other way around)
- [ ] Make Grappling Hook distance depend on length of button pressed (Mace)
** Game Code
- [ ] Baseball -> Shoved but not dead (stumbling) dash attack in same direction
  for "ultra" shove

* Ideas
** Player
- [ ] Charge shove when in shield mode
- [ ] Chargable attack
- [ ] Heaps of Corpses
  1. On Death Corpses draw additively (a simplified texture) to corpse RenderTexture (With a pixel of 1)
  2. RenderTexture is blurred
  3. Render texture is converted to Objects by doing some kind of flood fill
** Wave System
*** (One) Wave
Each wave spawns a set number of enemies
**** Timing
**** Spawn Location

*** Endless Mode
Generate random waves with increasing difficulty
**** Randomness
**** Difficulty

*** Scripted Mode
Isn't really interesting yet but perhaps some kind of node based wave system.
Some Nodes are "Waves" e.g. what will spawn. and other nodes are spawn
conditions that can be combined by or / and nodes?
